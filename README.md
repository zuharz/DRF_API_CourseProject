# Django Rest Framework API Course Final Project
META Back-End Developer REST API course final project implemented by Siarhei Sushynski

Please, note - I am publishing this code exclusively for the purpose of demonstrating my course results to my future potential employers.

P.s. 
Dear "future colleagues" studying on the same course, please, keep in mind that you'd better make all the course assignments by yourself for your own good and don't use this code to complete the course without getting deep understanding why and what has been done in this or that way.
